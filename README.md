# “MEAN Stack”.replace(“A”, “OpenUI5”)
  
In the UI5 world there is a belief that UI5 is not to be used out of the SAP world. Frankly, the reality is quite different.
In our session we will show you how you can use UI5 “out of the box” and easily integrate our framework into any hype or stack.
We’ll build a modern full stack App from scratch, using OpenUI5 as frontend layer.

## Steps

In this step we'll build some of the business logic behind our application. We'll handle all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to update mocked data.

**Note:** Please keep in mind that all operations would be applied over the mocked data. Therefore, no persistency would be available. We'll enable real persistency later, when we build the backend and integrate it with the frontend.
