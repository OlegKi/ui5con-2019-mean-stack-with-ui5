# “MEAN Stack”.replace(“A”, “OpenUI5”)
  
In the UI5 world there is a belief that UI5 is not to be used out of the SAP world. Frankly, the reality is quite different.
In our session we will show you how you can use UI5 “out of the box” and easily integrate our framework into any hype or stack.
We’ll build a modern full stack App from scratch, using OpenUI5 as frontend layer.

## Steps

In this step we'll update the ``.ts`` files in order to be valid TypeScript and pass the TSLint checks.

After completing this step run ``npm run frontend:tslint`` to see the results- successfully validated ``.ts`` files.
